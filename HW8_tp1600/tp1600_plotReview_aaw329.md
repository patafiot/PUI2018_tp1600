## Plot review for [tp1600](https://github.com/patafiot/PUI2018_tp1600/tree/master/HW8_tp1600)

![tp1600's plot](https://github.com/patafiot/PUI2018_tp1600/blob/master/HW8_tp1600/pui_hw81.png)

The plot is visually clear to understand overall, and shows clearly the patterns mentioned in the caption, but I would suggest modifying the color scheme since it might be a bit difficult to discern the pink/red/orange lines for someone with colorblindness (tested with deuteranopia mode using the Color Oracle app). The different line types (dotted, dashed, solid) do help mitigate this, though. 

In addition, I would recommend removing the categories that are shaded areas (total children in shelter & total adults in shelter) from the legend for the lines and including an additional, separate legend for the shaded areas (i.e. with small colored boxes next to the labels instead of lines). I think having the two shaded areas helps you easily compare the two pieces of data accurately and supports your point in the caption, but it took me a little bit to realize exactly what the shaded portions were based on the information in the legend.

“(2014-2018)” in the x-axis title is redundant, since it’s both in the plot title and the x-axis labels themselves. The x-axis ticks/labels actually convey more accurate information, since the data used actually starts in August of 2013, so I would recommend including the months to the plot title for increased clarity.
